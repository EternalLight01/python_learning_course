# And now we will work with other operators. The code has variables a and b.
# Your task: declare 2 new variables:
# exp must contain the result of raising a to the power of b
# mod must contain the remainder of dividing a by b.
# Pay attention: do not change the value of variables a and b and do not delete them.

a = 7
b = 2
# write your code below this line

exp = a ** b
mod = a % b
