# The code has variables a and b. Your task: evaluate 4 new changes:
# addition should write the sum of a and b
# subtraction must float the difference of a and b
# division should publish the result of integer division of a by b
# multiplication should print the product of a and b.
# example:
# addition = a + b
# Pay attention: do not change the value of changed a and b and do not delete them.

a = 10
b = 2
# write your code below this line

addition = a + b
subtraction = a - b
division = a // b
multiplication = a * b
