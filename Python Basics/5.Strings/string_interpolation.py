# Declare a new variable result_string. To write its value, use the already declared variables a and b. 
# The result should be the following line: Hello, world!.
# Pay attention to the space, comma and exclamation point that should be in the result.
# Example:
# a = "Hello"
# result = f"{a}!!!"  # contains the string "Hello!!!"

a = "Hello"
b = "world"
# write your code below this line

result_string = f"{a}, {b}!"
