# Declare a new variable result_string. Its value is "glued together" from the already declared variables a, b and c, so that the result is a "Concatenation" string.

# Example:
# a = "llo"
# b = "He"
# result = b + a + "!"  # Contains the string "Hello!

a = "Con"
b = "enation"
c = "cat"
# write your code below

result_string = a + c + b

print(result_string)
